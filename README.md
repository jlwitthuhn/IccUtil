A simple utility to display properties of ICC color profile files.

Most of the color conversion math is copied from the [colour](https://github.com/colour-science/colour) python library.

It is capable of displaying the headers of an ICC v2 profile as well as the names and types of tags contained in that profile, but not the contents of those tags.

It can also draw a chromaticity diagram.
